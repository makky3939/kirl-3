D001 several
D001 types
D001 of
D001 queries
D001 are
D001 widely
D001 used
D001 on
D001 the
D001 world
D001 wide
D001 web
D001 and
D001 the
D001 expected
D001 retrieval
D001 method
D001 can
D001 vary
D001 depending
D001 on
D001 the
D001 query
D001 type
D001 we
D001 propose
D001 a
D001 method
D001 for
D001 classifying
D001 queries
D001 into
D001 informational
D001 and
D001 navigational
D001 types
D002
D002 because
D002 terms
D002 in
D002 navigational
D002 queries
D002 often
D002 appear
D002 in
D002 anchor
D002 text
D002 for
D002 links
D002 to
D002 other
D002 pages
D002 we
D002 analyze
D002 the
D002 distribution
D002 of
D002 query
D002 terms
D002 in
D002 anchor
D002 texts
D002 on
D002 the
D002 web
D002 for
D002 query
D002 classification
D002 purposes
D002 while
D002 content-based
D002 retrieval
D002 is
D002 effective
D002 for
D002 informational
D002 queries
D002 anchor-based
D002 retrieval
D002 is
D002 effective
D002 for
D002 navigational
D002 queries
D003
D003 our
D003 retrieval
D003 system
D003 combines
D003 the
D003 results
D003 obtained
D003 with
D003 the
D003 content-based
D003 and
D003 anchor-based
D003 retrieval
D003 methods
D003 in
D003 which
D003 the
D003 weight
D003 for
D003 each
D003 retrieval
D003 result
D003 is
D003 determined
D003 automatically
D003 depending
D003 on
D003 the
D003 result
D003 of
D003 the
D003 query
D003 classification
D003 we
D003 also
D003 propose
D003 a
D003 method
D003 for
D003 improving
D003 anchor-based
D003 retrieval
D004
D004 our
D004 retrieval
D004 method
D004 which
D004 computes
D004 the
D004 probability
D004 that
D004 a
D004 document
D004 is
D004 retrieved
D004 in
D004 response
D004 to
D004 the
D004 given
D004 query
D004 identifies
D004 synonyms
D004 of
D004 query
D004 terms
D004 in
D004 the
D004 anchor
D004 texts
D004 on
D004 the
D004 web
D004 and
D004 uses
D004 these
D004 synonyms
D004 for
D004 smoothing
D004 purposes
D004 in
D004 the
D004 probability
D004 estimation
D004 we
D004 use
D004 the
D004 ntcir
D004 test
D004 collections
D004 and
D004 show
D004 the
D004 effectiveness
D004 of
D004 individual
D004 methods
D004 and
D004 the
D004 entire
D004 web
D004 retrieval
D004 system
D004 experimentally
D005
D005 we
D005 propose
D005 a
D005 cross-media
D005 lecture-on-demand
D005 system
D005 called
D005 lodem
D005 which
D005 searches
D005 a
D005 lecture
D005 video
D005 for
D005 specific
D005 segments
D005 in
D005 response
D005 to
D005 a
D005 text
D005 query
D005 we
D005 utilize
D005 the
D005 benefits
D005 of
D005 text
D005 audio
D005 and
D005 video
D005 data
D005 corresponding
D005 to
D005 a
D005 single
D005 lecture
D006
D006 lodem
D006 extracts
D006 the
D006 audio
D006 track
D006 from
D006 a
D006 target
D006 lecture
D006 video
D006 generates
D006 a
D006 transcription
D006 by
D006 large-vocabulary
D006 continuous
D006 speech
D006 recognition
D006 and
D006 produces
D006 a
D006 text
D006 index
D006 a
D006 user
D006 can
D006 formulate
D006 text
D006 queries
D006 using
D006 the
D006 textbook
D006 related
D006 to
D006 the
D006 target
D006 lecture
D006 and
D006 can
D006 selectively
D006 view
D006 specific
D006 video
D006 segments
D006 by
D006 submitting
D006 those
D006 queries
D007
D007 experimental
D007 results
D007 showed
D007 that
D007 by
D007 adapting
D007 speech
D007 recognition
D007 to
D007 the
D007 lecturer
D007 and
D007 the
D007 topic
D007 of
D007 the
D007 target
D007 lecture
D007 the
D007 recognition
D007 accuracy
D007 was
D007 increased
D007 and
D007 consequently
D007 the
D007 retrieval
D007 accuracy
D007 was
D007 comparable
D007 with
D007 that
D007 obtained
D007 by
D007 human
D007 transcription
D008
D008 lodem
D008 is
D008 implemented
D008 as
D008 a
D008 client-server
D008 system
D008 on
D008 the
D008 web
D008 to
